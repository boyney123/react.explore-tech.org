# React Responsive Tables
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adam-hanna/react-responsive-tables.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adam-hanna/react-responsive-tables) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/adam-hanna/react-responsive-tables/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/adam-hanna/react-responsive-tables)

Better responsive tables for react! For smaller screens, this library converts a standard html table into a two column table, with the header as the first column and the corresponding data in the second column.
